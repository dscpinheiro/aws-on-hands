This a checklist on learning AWS. Since I'm not working with it at the moment, it should also work as a refresher.
The list is based on this great Reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8inzn5/so_you_want_to_learn_aws_aka_how_do_i_learn_to_be/

1. Account Basics 
    - [x] Create an IAM user for personal use
    - [x] Set up MFA for your root user, turn off all root user API keys
    - [x] Set up Billing Alerts
    - [x] Configure the AWS CLI for your user
2. Web Hosting Basics
    - [x] Deploy a EC2 VM and host a simple static web page
    - [x] Take a snapshot of your VM, delete the VM, and deploy a new one from the snapshot. Basically disk backup + disk restore
3. Auto Scaling
4. External Data
5. Web Hosting Platform-as-a-Service
6. Microservices
7. Serverless
8. Cost Analysis
9. Automation
10. Continuous Delivery
